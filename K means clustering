K-means clustering is a unsupervised learning algorithm , which aims to group the n unlabelled observations into k similar clusters.
The algorithm iteratively tries to find locally optimal clusters defined using centroids or eulars.
This code uses NumPy Python Library using the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm.
